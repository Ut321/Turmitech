Platform Configuration
The app automatically detects your platform and uses the correct API URL:

Android Emulator: http://10.0.2.2:3000
iOS Simulator: http://localhost:3000
Physical Device: http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:3000 // NOTE use same network when run


For Physical Device Testing:

Find your computer's IP address:

# Windows
ipconfig

# macOS/Linux
ifconfig


Start server with IP binding:

json-server --watch db.json --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0
